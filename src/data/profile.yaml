about: |
  I am a graduate student pursuing Master of Science (Thesis) in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University.
  My research focuses on heterogeneous CPU-GPU training for large language models, distributed systems, and
  high-performance computing. I have experience in machine learning systems, computer architecture, and edge computing.

  Previously, I worked as a Project Associate at the Middleware and Runtime Systems Lab at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc),
  where I developed frameworks for efficient LLM training on heterogeneous systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in
  Electronics and Communication Engineering from PES University.
