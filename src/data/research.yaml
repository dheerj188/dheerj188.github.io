overview: |
  My research focuses on efficient large language model training on heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems,
  distributed machine learning, and high-performance computing. I am particularly interested in
  optimizing resource utilization and reducing training time for large-scale AI workloads.

  At IISc, I designed a hybrid CPU-GPU training framework that achieved up to 17% reduction in training
  time for models like Llama2 and GPT2 compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. My work involves
  developing novel scheduling strategies, implementing producer-consumer pipelines, and integrating with
  PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel framework.
